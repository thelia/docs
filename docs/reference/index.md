# Reference Documentation

Technical reference documentation for Thelia's core systems.

## Core Systems

### Events

Thelia uses Symfony's event dispatcher to allow modules to react to various actions throughout the system. Events enable decoupled communication between components.

See [Events Reference](./events) for the complete list of available events.

### Forms

Thelia's form system is built on Symfony Forms, providing validation, CSRF protection, and easy template rendering.

See [Forms Reference](./forms) for form creation and handling.

### Internationalization

Thelia supports multiple languages and locales out of the box. Learn how to translate your modules and templates.

See [Internationalization](./internationalization) for i18n documentation.

## CLI Commands

Thelia provides console commands for common operations like cache management, module handling, and database operations.

See [CLI Reference](./cli/) for all available commands.
